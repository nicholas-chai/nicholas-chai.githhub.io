                <h4 class="emphasis-text">NGIS Australia, 2011 to Present:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Principal Level GIS Consultant and WA GIS Team Manager:</b> As an NGIS Consultant Nick has been directly responsible for the delivery and management of spatial projects for large organisations throughout Australia across multiple industries including mining, government and agriculture. As a team leader within the business, Nick has also been responsible for the recruiting and development of junior to senior level consultants and continues to train internal teams as new technologies develop within the GIS space.<br /><br /></li>
                    
                    <li><b>Solution Architect, GIS Analyst, Developer, Account Manager:</b> Account management of NGIS’s various clients including FMG, Rio Tinto, BHP BMA Coal, the Department of education, a number of port authorities through ought WA and various local councils. Nick started his career from a junior level GIS consultant and has consistently been part of the implementation and delivery process of numerous projects over the years. Nick has a sound understanding of the underlying GIS technologies and is capable of development and implementation but also capable of taking lead on a project and stepping into a front end role working directly with the client in a project management or sales capacity. Nick has also delivered training to large audiences on GIS technology and been responsible for the continued development of team members within NGIS as a manager.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="emphasis-text">NT Government - Department of Lands 2023:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In response to evolving technological requirements and in pursuit of maintaining optimal performance, NTLIS embarked on a journey to upgrade its ArcGIS Enterprise environment from version 10.8.1 to the latest iteration, 10.9.1.
                        
                    Challenges involved with this upgrade was that it needed to be done within a distributed RedHat linux environment.
                    
                    After successful project delivery documentation was written outlining various challenges and corresponding solutions with detailed commands recorded to reduce the burden on future upgrades within the environment.<br /></li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="emphasis-text">Department of Defence, Research and Development - Hologram Table 2019/2022:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lead the NGIS team in collaboration with Skyline and Axiom, the world leaders in hologram equipment, to create a Commander’s Augmented Reality Mission Support Application System (C-ARMSAS) as an innovative exploration of concepts for the Australian Army. 

                    C-ARMSAS was a next generation technology that could be used to assist in mission planning, war-gaming, and execution capability. The holographic technology would allow commanders to use real-time intelligence-based information while planning in the battle space. The system allows an easy visual interaction between leaders and soldiers to show what the plans are visually. 
                    
                    This implementation involved the development of an interface to bridge the communication between the users, the Axiom holographics hardware and the skyline terraexplroer desktop application using GIS and web technolgies such as Typescript, Javascript, HTML, CSS.<br /></li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="emphasis-text">BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA Coal), 2015/2016:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>This project aimed to enhance the ability of the BHP staff and contractors to better visualize the current (to the day) state of mining activity on the Goonyella Mine Site in a spatially accurate 3D globe. 
                    As a Solution Architect, GIS Analyst, Developer the primary activities included deployment of Skyline software stack including TerraExplorer, TerraBuilder, TerraGate and SFS Feature Service for BHP BMA Coal. Responsibilities in this role involved the entire deployment process of delivering a 3D, real time globe by integrating existing UAV and satellite orthophotography with current DEM data in order to produce a spatially accurate 3D representation of the Goonyella Mine Site with live asset tracking data and sophisticated analysis tools.<br /><br /></li>
